## Java Programming Exercises - University of Helsinki MOOC

### About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the programming exercises from the University of Helsinki's MOOC on Java. This course provided a comprehensive introduction to programming in Java, and the exercises here represent my journey through the course, showcasing my skills development in Java programming.
What's Inside

The exercises cover various aspects of Java programming, including:

    Basics of Java programming: variables, data types, and control structures.
    Object-oriented programming concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
    Data structures, algorithms, and more advanced programming techniques.

Each directory within this repository corresponds to a specific part or topic of the course.
How to Use This Repository

    Exploring Solutions: You can browse through the directories to see my solutions for each exercise. This might be useful if you're also taking the course and need a reference or if you're just interested in different approaches to solving these problems.
    Running the Code: To run any of these programs, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. Clone the repository, navigate to the specific exercise directory and compile/run the Java files as usual.

### Disclaimer

These solutions are my own and were submitted as part of the course requirements. They are shared here for educational purposes. If you're a current student of the course, I strongly encourage you to attempt the exercises yourself first before referring to my solutions.

### Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank the University of Helsinki for providing this excellent course free of charge. The course was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of Java and object-oriented programming.
